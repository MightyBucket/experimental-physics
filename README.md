# experimental-physics
An experimental physics sandbox engine developed in Python with PyGame. You can read more about it [here](https://mightybucket.github.io/projects/2017/05/31/python-physics-engine.html).

I started this as a personal project so that I could better understand my engineering mechanics modules at university. 

On the surface, there isn't much to look at but there is a lot of impressive functionality to be harnessed. This would also be far more usable if I fixed a couple of bugs.

The last time I touched this was around 2017 so it's been a while since it was last updated. But feel free to contact me if you'd like to contribute of give feedback!
